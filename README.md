# Back-End Project

This is a Python backend project powered by **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn**.  
It provides APIs for handling requests and is designed to run in a virtual environment.

Step 2: Create & Activate Virtual Environment
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
python -m venv .venv

Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\activate

Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn main:app --reload --reload-exclude ".venv/*"
